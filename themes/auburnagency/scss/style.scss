/*
 * SETTINGS
 * This layer should only house settings that need to be accessed from anywhere, including Sass variables.
 * Examples of global settings might be things like the base font size, colour palettes, and so on.

 * TOOLS
 * This layer should include global mixins and functions.
 * Any mixin or function that does not need accessing globally should belong in the partial to which it relates.

/*
 * GENERIC
 * The Generic layer is the first one that actually produces any CSS.
 * It houses very high-level, far reaching styles.
 * This layer is seldom modified, and is usually the same across any projects you work on.
 * It contains things like Normalize.css, global box-sizing rules, CSS resets and so on.
 *
 *
 * NOTE: You probably only need one of the following...
 *
 * Reset.css unstyles every element.
 * Normalize.css styles browsers to render elements more consistently with each other.
 * Sanitize.css styles browsers to render elements more consistently with developer expectations and preferences.

/*
 * ELEMENTS
 * These are bare, unclassed HTML elements.
 * It is very rarely added to or changed after initial setup.
 * Once we have defined element-level styles, all additions and deviations should be implemented using classes.

/*
 * OBJECTS
 * This is the first layer in which we find class-based selectors.
 * These are concerned with styling non-cosmetic design patterns, or 'objects'.
 * Objects can range from something as simple as a .wrapper element, to layout systems, to media objects.

/*
 * COMPONENTS
 * The Components layer is where we begin to style recognizable pieces of UI.
 * We shouldn't find any selectors with a lower specificity than one class in this layer.
 * This is where the majority of your work will happen after initial project set-up.
 * Adding new components and features usually makes up the vast majority of development.

 * This layer beats – or 'trumps' – all other layers.

 * It is inelegant and heavy-handed, and contains utility and helper classes, hacks and overrides.
 * The !important tags should go here.
